quote: "In our society, let alone in the world of animation, there is a tendency to draw a line that separates 'children's entertainment' from 'adult entertainment.' But that line is very thin, and that thin line is what makes the heart—a heart that can feel sad. That's a heart that can feel joy. That's a heart that can feel love."

In our society, let alone in the world of animation, there is a tendency to draw a line that separates 'children's entertainment' from 'adult entertainment.' But that line is very thin, and that thin line is what makes the heart—a heart that can feel sad. That's a heart that can feel joy. That's a heart that can feel love.

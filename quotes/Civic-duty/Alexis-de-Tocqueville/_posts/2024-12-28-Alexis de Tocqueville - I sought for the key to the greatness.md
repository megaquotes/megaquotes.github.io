author: Alexis de Tocqueville
quote: "I sought for the key to the greatness and genius of America in her harbors and rivers, and it was not there; I sought for it in her fertile fields and boundless forests, and it was not there; I sought for it in her rich mines and her vast world commerce, and it was not there; I sought for it in her matchless Constitution, and it was not there. It was then that I discovered the key; it was not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness that I understood the secret of her genius and power."

I sought for the key to the greatness and genius of America in her harbors and rivers, and it was not there; I sought for it in her fertile fields and boundless forests, and it was not there; I sought for it in her rich mines and her vast world commerce, and it was not there; I sought for it in her matchless Constitution, and it was not there. It was then that I discovered the key; it was not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness that I understood the secret of her genius and power.

- Alexis de Tocqueville

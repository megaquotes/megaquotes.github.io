If we take in our hand any volume; of this kind, let us ask, does it contain any abstract reasoning about quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. I pretend not to explain; but to name. It describes what has happened, what is happening, and what must happen, and that is all.

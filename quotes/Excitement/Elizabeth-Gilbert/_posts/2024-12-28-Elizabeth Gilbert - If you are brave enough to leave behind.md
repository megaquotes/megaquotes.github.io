quote: "If you are brave enough to leave behind everything familiar and comforting, which can be anything from your house to bitter, old grudges, and set out on a truth-seeking journey, either externally or internally, and if you are truly willing to regard everything that happens to you on that journey as a clue and to assist you in your quest, then the truth will not be hidden from you."

If you are brave enough to leave behind everything familiar and comforting, which can be anything from your house to bitter, old grudges, and set out on a truth-seeking journey, either externally or internally, and if you are truly willing to regard everything that happens to you on that journey as a clue and to assist you in your quest, then the truth will not be hidden from you.

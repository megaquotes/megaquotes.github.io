quote: "If you want a thing bad enough to go out and fight for it, to work day and night for it, to give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it, if all that you dream and scheme is about it, and life seems useless and worthless without it, and if you gladly sweat for it and fret for it and plan for it and lose all your terror of the risks and the worry of opposition for it, if you simply go after that thing that you want with all your capacity, strength and sagacity, with faith, hope and confidence and stern pertinacity, if neither cold, poverty, or famished giants, or sickness, or pain, or body and brain can keep you from getting it, then I’d say, ‘Keep going!’"

If you want a thing bad enough to go out and fight for it, to work day and night for it, to give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it, if all that you dream and scheme is about it, and life seems useless and worthless without it, and if you gladly sweat for it and fret for it and plan for it and lose all your terror of the risks and the worry of opposition for it, if you simply go after that thing that you want with all your capacity, strength and sagacity, with faith, hope and confidence and stern pertinacity, if neither cold, poverty, or famished giants, or sickness, or pain, or body and brain can keep you from getting it, then I’d say, ‘Keep going!’

To those who would tear the world down: We will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security: We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America’s beacon still burns bright: tonight we prove once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms, but from the enduring power of our ideals – democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.

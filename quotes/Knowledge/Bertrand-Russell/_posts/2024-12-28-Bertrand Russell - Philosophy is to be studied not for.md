author: Bertrand Russell
quote: "Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definitive answer can, in fact, be known, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because these questions are, by their nature, unanswered, they drive us to seek out, to learn, to grow."

Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definitive answer can, in fact, be known, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because these questions are, by their nature, unanswered, they drive us to seek out, to learn, to grow.

- Bertrand Russell

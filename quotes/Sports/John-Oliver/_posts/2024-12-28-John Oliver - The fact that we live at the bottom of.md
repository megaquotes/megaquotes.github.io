The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 93 million miles away, and that our brief, brief lives are ushered in and out of this world by the unfathomable randomness of the universe — is it too much to ask that we not make it worse?

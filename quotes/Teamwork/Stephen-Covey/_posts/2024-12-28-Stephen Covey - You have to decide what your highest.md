author: Stephen Covey
quote: "You have to decide what your highest priorities are and have the courage—pleasantly, smilingly, nonapologetically—to say 'no' to other things. And the way to develop the courage is to look at your four endowments: your self-awareness, your conscience, your independent will, and your creative imagination."

You have to decide what your highest priorities are and have the courage—pleasantly, smilingly, nonapologetically—to say 'no' to other things. And the way to develop the courage is to look at your four endowments: your self-awareness, your conscience, your independent will, and your creative imagination.
